I spent over $125 i think  for the free shipping but im sorry i was expecting slightly better packaging considering your products are so beautifully packaged? I opened the box to find that a few of my items had fallen out of their little boxes which made me panic because i thought they had fallen out of the actual package itself but luckily they were nestled underneath the other items i purchased.

My inquiry case no. was 13062-12054. \nI emailed again on 1st July 2013, informing that I had not received my order and I received the reply that I should wait till 13th July 2013, as sometimes international orders are delayed due to custom issues. I waited again. My inquiry case no. was 13070-12517. \nDiligently, I emailed once again on 14th July informing you that I have still not received my order. I immediately got the reply that $135 will be refunded to my credit card and will appear within 5-7 days. My inquiry case no. was 13071-53325. I waited to receive my notification about the refund.\n On 19th July 2013, I emailed to confirm if the refund request has been processed, I received the below reply from your customer service \nYour Benefit Cosmetics Inquiry Case # [13071-93554] Hi Eram, After reviewing your account, I see that we refunded $120.00 to your credit card, on June 21st, 2013. Please note that refunds may take 1 - 2 weeks to post to your account. Thank you for shopping with Benefit Cosmetics! \nFirst of all, I would like to know why do you create different case numbers for the inquiry of one and the same order. It is so difficult to keep track of so many numbers. Second of all, I would like to know why was I refunded on 21st June 2013, when on my constant touch with your customer service I was asked repeatedly to wait till 45 days. What was the reason for the refund and why did I not receive any email notifying me of this. And most importantly why did I get the refund for $120 only? I specifically placed an order for $135 as I was getting free international shipping. And I have checked your website, nowhere is it mentioned that there are any penalty charges. And why should I suffer any penalty anyways. You failed to deliver my order, therefore, the fault is completely yours. By the way, I have not received this amount as well uptill now\n. I had no idea, that such a famous brand would have such shoddy website service. I have received numerous orders from USA and UK based shopping websites, and never have my orders ever been lost or not delivered. I stay in a country which has an excellent postal delivery system and therefore no blame can be placed at this end. \nI am appalled by the casual manner in which my complaint has been taken. I mean, no one had the courtesy to offer a simple apology about the inconvenience I have faced and the heartache of not having my favorite products delivered. I have waited enough and I am highly upset and I mean HIGHLY. I want an immediate resolution to my complaint and I want THE FULL AMOUNT OF $135 refunded to my credit card without any delay. Rest assured, I will not be recommending any of my friends to purchase from your website. Awaiting your reply and immediate action Eram", "how do I send a free gift to my bff? please answer\n", "No_Answer"], ["Hello, :) My name is Anna and I am currently living in San Francisco and looking for a job working for Benefit because it has always been the company that stood out to me and has been my go to from the beginning of me using makeup. I have been modeling for over a year now here in SF and have had a lot of experience and lessons from the MUA\u2019s that have worked with me, they have taught me a lot and shown me a passion for makeup and beauty, but most of all they showed me which products were their favorite.

I am going to be a female senior in high school on September 9, 2013 and have a goal. \n\nLet me tell you a little bit of myself: I want to study fashion merchandising in Fashion Institute of Technology (a.k.a. FIT) in New York City. I also want to start a Youtube Channel as a \u201cBeauty Guru\u201d and become the CEO of Victoria\u2019s Secret. I know, it\u2019s a big dream but hey, without a dream, nobody would get anywhere.  I also want to try acting because it seems to be in the family genetics and I am a natural at crying. I will do all this while working as a \u201cBeauty Guru\u201d of course. \n\nMore realistically though, if my dream doesn\u2019t go as planned: I will study at Rutgers University in New Brunswick and open up multiple school and orphanages because I have a passion and talent for working with children while working as a \u201cBeauty Guru\u201d of course. \n\nThere are two things that are similar in both, my dream and my goal. I have ambition and want to become a Youtube \u201cBeauty Guru\u201d. I know this may sound extremely clich\u00e9 but I feel that I am the next \u201cMichelle Phan\u201d. Maybe not as big as Michelle Phan because she is just, so, amazing but I feel that I will follow her footsteps. \n\nWhy am I telling you this? I need your help. I have no videos on my Youtube Channel. Yes, I know, sketchy. But believe me, I am working on it. As soon as I finish editing I will be more than glad to send it to you. So, I have a request and I know this may sound crazy but I would love to sponsor the company on my Youtube Channel.

She is 29y old mother of 3. She is also fighting a rare form of appendix/colon carcinoma. As I said she is my best friend. Growing up very poor with a single mom working 2 jobs we were all each other had. We have always been very close. So needless to say when she received the news that she had cancer, we were crushed!! I cannot even begin to describe the feeling. She is my little sister and I am supposed to protect her, I felt somehow responsible. Anyway so here is the condensed version.... She recently finished a 3 month grueling round of chemo only to receive the devastating news that not only was her residual tumor still there but 2 others were now showing on her scan. So she just went through a 6 hour surgery to remove as much as possible of the tumors from the colon and appendical orifice. She has a 50% prognosis at this point. She is recovering but may need a colostomy to continue bowel function. So why am I writing to you?????........ I am hoping for your help. As I said my sister has gone through a lifetime of sadness and pain in the past few months yet she NEVER complains, and never treats herself to anything. I know she has a huge recovery ahead of her and I am trying to put together a really nice basket of some of her favorite things to help  her pamper herself. I would love to just go buy them all, BUT I myself have a disabled husband and daughter and my finances are so tight I feel they could \"snap\" at anytime so I just do not have the means to do so. So I am hoping that you would be gracious enough to donate some of your wonderful products which are some of her faves.

She received the devastating news last week that not only had the residual tumor  at the tip of her colon still there but she now has 2 other tumors now in her liver. She has 3 children at home.

Thank you so much!\n\nhttp://gfwd.at/1tZIg5I\n\nKCNQ2 is a gene involved in the proper functioning of a potassium channel in the brain. Abnormal changes, or mutations, in the gene are associated with seizures. KCNQ2-related epilepsies represent a spectrum of conditions from mild to severe. In 1998, mutations in KCNQ2 were associated with a mild condition called \u201cBenign Familial Neonatal Epilepsy\u201d or BFNE. Babies with BFNE have seizures that begin shortly after birth and then stop within several months. Development is usually normal. BFNE may run in families, as the name implies.\n\nResearchers recently identified different mutations in KCNQ2 that are associated with a severe form of neonatal epilepsy. This severe, non-inherited (de novo) form has been called several names: KCNQ2 encephalopathy, KCNQ2-related neonatal epileptic encephalopathy, KCNQ2-deficiency syndrome, and KCNQ2-related epilepsy. As more patients are diagnosed with this emerging condition, doctors are finding that this mutation contributes to a spectrum of clinical outcomes that includes developmental problems ranging from moderate to severe.\n\n\nWhat is the treatment?\n\nOnce babies are diagnosed with seizures, they may be given standard medications to prevent seizures. Although there is no specific treatment, seizures may respond well to sodium channel blockers according to reports in the medical literature. Hopefully, specific treatments that lead to a better outcome will be discovered in the future. Right now, there are new seizure medications being studied that specifically target the KCNQ2 potassium channels, but the effectiveness and safety of these drugs must be proven in rigorous clinical trials before we know if these are better than standard treatments. Research plans are underway for clinical trials to find the best and safest treatments for KCNQ2-related epilepsy. In the meantime, seizure control and intensive therapy are essential to achieve the best developmental outcome possible.\n\nWhat is the prognosis?\n\nOf patients reported in the medical literature, prognosis appears to be variable. Seizures may eventually come under control with medication. Most, but not all, children will have fewer or no seizures after approximately age 3 years, but developmental delays may become more evident as the child grows older. In the majority of KCNQ2-related epilepsy cases reported in the medical literature, the child is slow to speak and is dependent on caregivers. Early diagnosis by genetic testing may avoid unnecessary evaluations for other causes.", "Hello ;) \nWould please post this link for Gwen?

This event will be held on January 9, 2015. \nAlexa is a vibrant young girl who shows a deep love for animals. She owns four dogs, two snakes, a bearded dragon, a blue tongued skink, fishes, guinea pigs, and of course, a turtle. When she grows up she wants to be a veterinarian. Alexa especially loves Monster Truck shows. She enjoys riding her dirt bike, playing lacrosse, and loves her Krav Maga class.\nWith your help, we are hoping that Alexa\u2019s fundraiser will be a great success. As you can imagine, the medical bills are astronomical and we are hoping that this fundraiser will help relieve some of the financial burden from her parents.\nI will be happy to make arrangements at your convenience to pick up any donations that you may have to offer, or you may send them to my address directly.

The foundation supports research to identify the causes of AHC, develop effective treatment protocols, and ultimately find a cure.  Through the education of healthcare professionals, we promote early and proper diagnosis of the disorder. \n\nWe are hosting an event called Wine Women and Shoes benefiting AHCF in June 2015 and are looking for key sponsorships.  Wine Women & Shoes fundraisers create an opportunity for partnerships between charities, wineries, shoe and accessory retailers, corporate sponsors and women in the community. In addition to raising money, these events raise awareness for charities, increase sales for wineries and retail partners and provide community exposure for corporate sponsors. Our Wine Women & Shoes event will be held at the Menlo Circus Club in Atherton and will feature: delicious bites, fabulous wines, a shopping marketplace, silent and live auction, raffle and fashion show.  Your audience will be 400+ affluent, well-educated, philanthropic-minded women ages 30-65.  This would be an amazing marketing opportunity for Benefit Cosmetics.

I returned to the Benefit Beauty Bar inside Macy\u2019s at Fashion Valley in San Diego, CA because I had been there before and had always had pleasant experiences. Unfortunately, after yesterday\u2019s appointment I will no longer be using Benefit\u2019s beauty services. The skin under my left eyebrow was burned. As soon as I got home and noticed the raw, red skin; I called the manager on duty (Andrea) and did as she instructed to take care of the wound. I am not on any medication or topical cream that make my skin more sensitive to waxing or prevent me from getting waxed. Thanks to Neosporin and Advil, the redness has gone down and no blisters have formed. I am very saddened by this because I love Benefit\u2019s products and had always received great service at the Beauty Bar. I think it\u2019s very important that you what happened to me so you can prevent this from happening to anyone else. I know that when getting waxed, you take a risk but getting burned is not acceptable.

Janelle hiltz takes really good care of me. Well I needed my makeup and eyelashes done so she recommended hillary or brittany. Great they were available went in today as i was having professional pictures taken. I had no idea that the same person doesnt do the eyelash application.  So Haleigh was the person applying my lashes. I picked the individual i always use those with makeup artists that have done my makeup, they are not heavy and look natural. As she is applying my lashes i see she is struggling wasting lots of lashes. Re pouring eyelash glue. She is done and shows me and it looks like no lashes are on. She tells me she went with smaller lashes bc my eyes are small. I told my makeup artists in the past use smaller on inside and longer on outer. So she says ok struggling again. I can feel globs of eyelash glue in my eye. I then get some in my eye its stings so much i see that she puts somethjng called remover in my eye with a qtip. It burns but then goes away. She put one long lash on the end and i am fine i had to get to getting my hair done. I leave and tell myself i will never have her do lashes again. As i am driving home i feel like i have something in my eye. I look in the mirror and aee beads of glue in my lash line and it feels uncomfortable. I get done with the photos around 7pm we go to dinner and i tell my husband i cant wait to get these lashes off. Well i try to pull them off and they dont budge. I get some use eyemakeup remover and ponds. And try to pull them off and some come off with my own lashes! I have had false lashes put on strip and individual and they come right off. At this point my eyes are red and the skin on my lashes hurts so bad. I then get in contact with Janelle (its 9pm and she graciously messages me back as i am panicking) and tells me they use stronger glue and not to try to take them off that i have to come in to have them removed??! What?!! No one told me this. When i had them done before it was regular glue. The peeled right off. I am so upset that no one at the store informed me off this and the special instructions on having to come back to the store to have the lashes removed. If i would of known i would not have had them put on. No one told me anything! Now i have my own lashes missing and have to miss church tomorrow so i can go in when the stores opens to have these removed because i look sally hoo from Dr Suess with one long eyelash on the end and highly irritated eyes! Please make sure that if customers want their eyelashes put on that they know that a normal eyelash glue is not used and the procedure necessary to remove before hand and have them sign a consent. If i wanted something not temporary I would have invested in eyelash extensions. Also i would not have gone to get them done at a makeup counter!

I am flying from France to New York today. \nMy address is 141 South 5th Street Apt 1E, 11211 New York\nThe aesthetician was Maud. \nMy appointment was originally at Sephora\n8bis Avenue Jean M\u00e9decin\nHowever they cancelled without telling me, and I didn\u2019t find out until I got in. I was eventually about to get into the Sephora down the street (they didn\u2019t OFFER to make the appointment there, I asked).\n\nHere\u2019s the email I sent about the incident earlier:\n\nHi,\n\nI\u2019ve had the most horrific experience and need to speak to someone. I booked in at 4pm at Sephora in Nice, only to book an Uber all the way from Villefranche to find out my appointment had been cancelled without apology. I then asked if there were any other places in the area to get them done and eventually the lady called a Sephora in Nice Etoile. I went in and we agreed on the natural wax and tint - with a bit of an arch. I was adamant on keeping them thick. \n\nThe lady showed the the first brow in a mirror and I burst into years. \nMy eyebrows are ruined. So thin and horrible and artificial looking. I am furious. I don\u2019t even know what to do. Despite them not charging me for my brows I was told I could \u201cfix it\u201d with Gimme Brow and was still charged TWENTY EIGHT EURO for the product to fix the mistake. I have not stopped crying since leaving Sephora. I look like a horrific combination of Joan Crawford in Mommy Dearest and Cruella DeVille. I have never been more upset and am now trying to find a hairdresser to cut bangs to hide this disaster. Something needs to happen. I\u2019m a beauty writer and was reporting on places to receive beauty treatments here - I trust benefit as a brand as visit Your store in Soho, New York, where I live, regularly. \n\nI am so angry and sad I don\u2019t even know what to do.

This is NOT what I expect from Benefit - the customer service I experienced this AM was dreadul and put a bad taste in my mouth.  All I got was pretty much I am sorry and that is it.  No how can we make this up to you?  Nothing.  Now I am stuck scrambling for a mediocre service from elsewhere and to be honest not even sure I will ever go back to Benefit after the terrible service.   This should be addressed with this location - Unacceptable.
